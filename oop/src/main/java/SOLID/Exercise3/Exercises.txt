Complete OOP Exercise (All SOLID Principles)
Topic: Order Management in an Online Store
Overall Objective: Create an OOP application that manages customer orders.

Features:
-create an order with products
-calculate the order total (with discounts)
-save the order
-send the customer notification
-export the order in text format

Stage 1 – Basic entities (Model)
-Client (abstract)
    -Inherited from GuestClient, RegisteredClient (LSP)
-Product
    -Name + unit price
-OrderItem
    -Product + quantity
-Order
    -Customer + list of OrderItem

Stage 2 – SRP (Separate responsibilities into distinct services)
-OrderService: Create orders
-OrderSaver: Save the order
-NotificationSender: Send notifications (email/sms)
-OrderExporter: Export the order in text format

Stage 3 – OCP (Discount Strategies)
-Use a DiscountStrategy interface
-Create implementations for:
-no discount
-percentage discount
-fixed discount
-You can add new discounts without changing the code existing

Stage 4 – LSP
-Client is abstract
-GuestClient → no discounts
-RegisteredClient → has discount strategy
-All clients can be used interchangeably without breaking the order logic.

Stage 5 – ISP
-Notifier has separate methods:
-EmailNotifiable
-SmsNotifiable
-EmailNotificationSender class implements EmailNotifiable only

Stage 6 – DIP
-OrderProcessor depends on:
-OrderSaver (interface)
-Notifier (interface)
-OrderExporter (interface)
